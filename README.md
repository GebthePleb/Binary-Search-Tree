# Binary-Search-Tree
My implementation of an array-based binary search tree.

BinarySearchTree.java:
This is the actual data structure. For details on the functions look in the file for comments.

mainDriver:
This is the driver/main function used to test and show off the BST.

Point.java:
This is a class of a basic user defiend object to show the generic nature of my BST algorithm.
